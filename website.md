LIQUID GLASS TECH PORTFOLIO WEBSITE PROMPT
Build a modern developer portfolio website using Apple's Liquid Glass design language with the following specifications:
Design System:

Implement Apple's Liquid Glass aesthetic with fluid, translucent glass-like elements
Use glassmorphism effects with backdrop-filter blur, semi-transparent backgrounds
Apply subtle gradient overlays and soft shadows for depth
Implement smooth, organic animations and micro-interactions
Use a dark theme as primary with light accents

Visual Elements:

Create floating glass cards for project showcases with blur effects
Design translucent navigation bars with glass morphism
Implement liquid-like hover states and smooth transitions
Add subtle glow effects and light refractions
Use soft, rounded corners and organic shapes throughout
Include animated glass particles or bubbles in the background

Layout Structure:

Hero section with animated glass elements and professional introduction
About section with glassmorphic card design
Skills section with glowing glass badges
Projects gallery with liquid glass overlay effects
Contact section with glass form elements
Responsive design optimized for all devices

Technical Implementation:

Use CSS backdrop-filter for authentic glass blur effects
Implement CSS transforms for smooth animations
Apply CSS gradients and box-shadows for depth
Use CSS variables for consistent glass theming
Include scroll-triggered animations for glass elements
Optimize for performance with efficient CSS and minimal JavaScript

Interactive Features:

Smooth scroll navigation with glass navigation dots
Hover effects that create ripple animations on glass surfaces
Project cards that tilt and glow on interaction
Form inputs with glass styling and focus states
Loading animations with liquid glass morphing effects

Content Sections:

Professional headshot with glass frame effect
Skills visualization with animated glass progress bars
Project showcase with glass overlay descriptions
Testimonials in floating glass containers
Social media links with glass icon backgrounds

Performance Considerations:

Optimize glass effects for smooth 60fps animations
Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
Implement lazy loading for heavy visual effects
Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios
Include fallbacks for browsers that don't support backdrop-filter

Create a portfolio that feels like it's floating in a liquid glass environment, with every element having that premium Apple aesthetic while maintaining excellent usability and performance.
